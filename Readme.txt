   Rooftop Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting rooftops in satellite imagery. It leverages a workflow involving Google Earth Pro for image acquisition, Roboflow for data annotation, and YOLOv8 for model training.

   Project Workflow

1.  Satellite Image Acquisition: Satellite images of the desired areas were obtained using Google Earth Pro. This allowed for flexible selection of geographic locations and zoom levels.

2.  Image Cropping: The acquired satellite images were then cropped to smaller, manageable tiles. This step helps in focusing the model training on relevant areas and improving efficiency.

3.  Data Annotation (Roboflow): The cropped images were uploaded to Roboflow, an online platform for computer vision dataset management. Using Roboflow's annotation tools, rooftops within the images were manually labeled. This process creates the ground truth data necessary for supervised learning.

4.  Dataset Preparation (Roboflow): Roboflow facilitates dataset versioning, preprocessing, and augmentation. The labeled dataset was processed and prepared for training the YOLOv8 model. This may have involved resizing images, applying augmentations (like flips, rotations, and brightness adjustments), and exporting the data in a format compatible with YOLOv8.

5.  Model Training (YOLOv8): The prepared dataset from Roboflow was used to train a YOLOv8 object detection model. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. The training process involves feeding the labeled images to the model and allowing it to learn the visual patterns associated with rooftops.

6.  Model Evaluation: After training, the performance of the YOLOv8 model was evaluated on a separate set of images (validation set) that the model had not seen during training. Metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision) were likely used to assess the model's ability to accurately detect rooftops.

7.  Inference: Once a satisfactory model was trained, it can be used to detect rooftops in new, unseen satellite images. This involves feeding the new images to the trained YOLOv8 model, which will then output the locations and confidence scores of detected rooftops.

   Code

The Python code for this project, as seen in `RoofTopDetection.ipynb`, likely includes the following steps:

 Environment Setup: Importing necessary libraries such as `torch` (for PyTorch, the framework YOLOv8 is built upon), potentially the YOLOv8 library (`ultralytics`), and other utility libraries.
 Data Loading: Code to load the prepared dataset from Roboflow (likely involving downloading a `.yaml` configuration file and image/label files).
 Model Loading: Loading a pre-trained YOLOv8 model or initializing a new one.
 Training Configuration: Setting training parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, image size, and potentially specifying a configuration file.
 Model Training: Running the training loop using the specified dataset and configuration.
 Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model on the validation set and printing performance metrics.
 Inference: Code demonstrating how to load the trained model and perform inference on new images or a directory of images. This would involve loading an image, passing it through the model, and visualizing or saving the detection results.
 Potentially: Code for visualizing the training and validation results, such as loss curves and mAP scores.

   Requirements

To run the code in `RoofTopDetection.ipynb`, you will likely need the following:

 Python 3.x
 PyTorch: Installation instructions can be found on the official PyTorch website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
 YOLOv8 (`ultralytics`): Install using pip: `pip install ultralytics`
 Roboflow API Key (if directly interacting with the Roboflow API in the notebook): You can find your API key in your Roboflow account settings.
 Other common Python libraries: such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python` (likely installed as dependencies of `ultralytics`).

   Usage

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable).
2.  Install the necessary requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a `requirements.txt` file is present). Otherwise, install the libraries mentioned in the Requirements section.
3.  Download the Roboflow dataset: Ensure that the YOLOv8 formatted dataset (including the `.yaml` file and image/label directories) from your Roboflow project is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory as expected by the notebook.
4.  Run the `RoofTopDetection.ipynb` notebook: Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially. You may need to adjust file paths and configurations within the notebook to match your local setup.
5.  For inference on new images: Modify the inference section of the notebook to point to the directory or specific images you want to analyze.

   Potential Improvements and Future Work

 Explore different YOLOv8 models: Experiment with different sizes of the YOLOv8 model (e.g., nano, small, medium) to find the best balance between speed and accuracy for the specific application.
 Data Augmentation Strategies: Investigate more advanced data augmentation techniques in Roboflow to improve the model's robustness to variations in image quality, lighting, and orientation.
 Handling Small Rooftops: Implement strategies to better detect very small or occluded rooftops, potentially by adjusting the model's architecture or using techniques like mosaic augmentation.
 Integration with Geospatial Tools: Explore integrating the model's output with geospatial libraries to perform further analysis, such as calculating the total rooftop area in a given region.
 Deployment: Consider deploying the trained model as an API or a standalone application for real-world use.
 Error Analysis: Conduct a thorough error analysis to understand the types of rooftops the model struggles to detect and focus on improving performance on those specific cases.
 Multi-class Rooftop Detection: If applicable, expand the project to detect different types of rooftops (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) by adding more classes during annotation.
